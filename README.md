Breast Cancer Detection

Overview
The Breast Cancer Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify breast cancer cases as malignant or benign. By leveraging a TensorFlow-based neural network, the model achieves an accuracy of 93.5%, making it a valuable tool for aiding healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Utilizes Pandas for data cleaning and preparation, ensuring high-quality input for model training.
Data Visualization: Employs Matplotlib to visualize data distributions, correlations, and patterns that inform feature selection.
Neural Network Architecture: Implements a robust neural network designed for binary classification tasks, incorporating dropout and batch normalization to enhance performance and reduce overfitting.
Real-World Application: Serves as a decision-support tool for medical practitioners, contributing to improved patient outcomes.

Technologies Used
